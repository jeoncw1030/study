  Bitnami LAMP Stack
  We created the Bitnami Project to help spread the adoption of freely available, high quality Open Source web applications. Bitnami aims to make it easier than ever to discover, download and install Open Source software such as document and content management systems, wikis and blogging software.

  You can learn more about Bitnami at https://bitnami.com

  The Bitnami LAMP Stack is an easy to install software platform that greatly simplifies the deployment of Open Source web stacks. It includes ready-to-run versions of Apache, MySQL and PHP. Bitnami LAMP Stack is distributed for free under the Apache 2.0 license.

  To get started with Bitnami LAMP Stack we suggest the following:

  1.- Check our documentation. The stack is self-contained and independent on your system, you can find all components in your installation directory: /opt/lampstack-7.1.12-0

  2.- Start the servers. Open the graphical "Manager" tool in your installation directory to start & stop the installed servers. You can also use "ctlscript.sh" from the command line prompt.

  3.- Add more apps. Download and install any Bitnami application module to run on top of this Stack.

  4.- Deploy your own project.
